<center> <h1> Enviroment pollution </h1></center>
 <p> Our environment is our assets, we should not lose the charm of the environment by pollution. We should deal with the environment of our earth like our mother because our earth also nurtures us and shelter us. If the climate gets polluted then will it be possible for us to live? The various types of pollution are Water pollution, soil pollution, noise pollution, land pollution, air pollution, etc. The contaminants of the environment are called pollutants.

<mark> The main pollutants come from industries because the factories release harmful and poisonous gases in the atmosphere.</mark> This the cause of air pollution. <u>The industrial effluents are also dumped into water bodies, causing water pollution</u>. The other pollutant responsible for pollution is the smoke from combustion, greenhouse gasses emission like carbon dioxide which is high in India.


<b>Environmental pollution increases global warming day by day, so the ice in Antarctica is melting and the harmful gases are also emitting and destroying the whole earth</b>.<strong> The animals have endangered, the plants are also dying. Cutting of trees is one of the reasons for environmental pollution</strong>.<i> So instead of cutting trees, we should plant more</i> <em>and more trees to enhance the beauty of Earth</em>. On 5th June, we celebrate World Environment Day, so not only we Mahotsav trees on that particular day, but we should plant trees whenever we think it is necessary to do.

We should also celebrate Van Mahotsav to spread the news that every individual should plant trees. It is the responsibility and commitment of every soul to preserve and protect our environment from getting polluted. There is another duty also that we have to perform we should not dump the waste materials in the river or seawater. We should burn them, then we will be able to produce biogas.</p>

<p>Once an old farmer had three sons. They could always quarreled with one another. One day the old farmer called his sons to bring some sticks and tied them in a bundle. He told them to break the bundle. They tried but could not break the bundle of the sticks. Then he told them to untie the bundle and gave a stick to sons and asked them to break it. Then all of them broke the stick easily. The farmer told them that if they would remain separate and quarreled with one another, the enemy would easily defeat them. But if they remained united like the bundle, they would be much stronger and the enemy could not do any harm to them. At this the three sons learnt a great lessons and began to live unitedly and happily. </p>
