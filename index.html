<center><h1> Winter Morning </h1></center>
<p>Winter is my favorite season for me. I like the season in the morning. I like to wake up late. In the winter the sun rises late. When the sun ray falls on the dew drops, it creates a fascinating scene. I become lazy in the winter. Nature seems hazy. There is cold air everywhere. The trees and grass look fresh and new in the winter. Life seems slowly everywhere. The sun can’t be seen in the sky sometimes. People get up late in the winter. Though it’s bitter cold in the morning, it’s enjoyable. In the morning, people don’t go out of home for the excessive cold. Sometimes people go out for a walk and enjoy nature. Trees are greener in the winter. The city people go late to their office. They feel relaxed. People save themselves under the blanket. In the village, people make sweet cakes. Traditional cakes are so tasty. People love to sit beside the fire. They sit together and feel the warmth. They love to feel warm. There are several other foods people make in the winter season. People eat different tasty foods in the winter morning. The juice of date is a special food in the winter. In the villages, people burn straw and makes fire. People go to their relative’s homes with traditionally sweet foods including cakes. The morning brings joy to us in the morning. A winter morning is comfortable and people enjoy it a lot. A winter morning is enjoyable for everyone. I like the winter morning.</p>
