	<center><h1><u>Winter Morning</u></h1></center>
<p style= color:red>Winter is my favorite season for me. I like the season in the morning. I like to wake up late. In the winter the sun rises late. When the sun ray falls on the dew drops, it creates a fascinating scene. I become lazy in the winter. Nature seems hazy. There is cold air everywhere. The trees and grass look fresh and new in the winter. Life seems slowly everywhere. The sun can’t be seen in the sky sometimes. People get up late in the winter. Though it’s bitter cold in the morning, it’s enjoyable. In the morning, people don’t go out of home for the excessive cold. Sometimes people go out for a walk and enjoy nature. Trees are greener in the winter. The city people go late to their office. They feel relaxed. People save themselves under the blanket. In the village, people make sweet cakes. Traditional cakes are so tasty. People love to sit beside the fire. They sit together and feel the warmth. They love to feel warm. There are several other foods people make in the winter season. People eat different tasty foods in the winter morning. The juice of date is a special food in the winter. In the villages, people burn straw and makes fire. People go to their relative’s homes with traditionally sweet foods including cakes. The morning brings joy to us in the morning. A winter morning is comfortable and people enjoy it a lot. A winter morning is enjoyable for everyone. I like the winter morning.

	<center><h1><u>Traffic Jam</u></h1></center>
	<p2>Traffic jams are a common sight in many cities around the world. They occur when there are more vehicles on the road than can move freely. Traffic jams can be caused by a variety of factors, including high traffic volume, accidents, construction, bad weather, and special events. High traffic volume is the most common cause of traffic jams, creating a bottleneck effect that hinders smooth traffic flow. Accidents can block lanes of traffic and cause significant delays. Construction zones can narrow lanes of traffic and slow down traffic flow. Bad weather conditions, such as rain, snow, and fog, can reduce visibility and make it difficult for drivers to see each other and the road ahead. Special events, such as sporting events and concerts, can generate a large volume of traffic and cause delays.

Traffic jams can have a number of negative consequences. They can cause people to be late for work, school, and other appointments. They can also waste fuel and increase air pollution. In addition, traffic jams can be stressful and frustrating for drivers and</p2>
	
	
	
<center><h1><u>Enviroment Pollution </u></h1></center>	
	<p class=enviroment>Our environment is affecting day by day due to pollution. There are various types of pollution like water pollution, soil pollution, air pollution, land pollution, etc. Pollution is destroying nature. Some are man-made pollution while others are natural pollution. The smoke that is emitted from the chimneys of the factories, from vehicles is the mixture of poisonous gases. Due to environmental pollution, the worst sufferers are the plants and animals. They are extinct every day.  No flora and fauna are safe here. Some animals are already in the list of endangered species. Due to water pollution, the Marine species are also dying.


The temperature is increasing and global warming is also increasing. The only way to eradicate environmental pollution is to plant many trees. By planting trees, we can get rid of many harmful poisonous gases. If the earth becomes green again, then pollution can be reduced and we will breathe the fresh air.</p>
